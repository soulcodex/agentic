## Using a skill outside a profile

Some profiles do not include every skill by default. There are two supported paths:

1. Persistent/additive path: add the skill to `.agentic/profile.yaml`, run `agentic sync` to update AGENTS composition, then run `agentic deploy <profile> [target] <vendor>` to refresh `.agentic/skills/`.
2. Ad hoc selective path: pass explicit skills during deploy, for example `agentic deploy <profile> <target> <vendor> --skills <skill-name>`.

When `--skills` is used, it acts as a selective override for that deployment rather than deploying the full library skill set.
